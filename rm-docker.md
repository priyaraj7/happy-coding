# How to Remove Everything Related to an App in Docker

## Introduction

Docker is a powerful tool for containerization that allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into isolated containers. However, sometimes you may need to remove all traces of a specific app from your Docker environment. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the steps to completely remove Docker containers and images associated with the particular app.

### Step 1: List Docker Containers Related to the App

The first step is to identify and list all Docker containers associated with your `app`. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker ps -a | grep <your docker-container-name>
```

This command will list all containers that include <your docker-container-name> in their name or description. Take note of the Container IDs for the containers you want to remove.

### Step 2: Stop and Remove Containers

Once you have identified the containers you wish to remove, you can proceed to stop and remove them. Replace `CONTAINER_ID` with the actual Container ID from the previous step. Run the following commands for each container:

```bash
docker stop <CONTAINER_ID>
docker rm <CONTAINER_ID>
```

The `docker stop` command will halt the specified container, and the `docker rm` command will remove it. Be cautious when executing these commands, as they are irreversible.

### Step 3: List Docker Images

Next, you should list all Docker images related to the specific app. Use the following command to identify them:

```bash
docker images | grep <your-docker-container-name>
```

This command will display a list of images with <your-docker-container-name> in their repository or tag. Make a note of the Image IDs for the images you want to delete.

### Step 4: Remove Images

Finally, you can remove the Docker images associated with the XYZ app. To do this, replace `IMAGE_ID` with the actual Image ID from the previous step and execute the following command:

```bash
docker rmi <IMAGE_ID>
```

The `docker rmi` command will delete the specified image. Again, exercise caution when removing images to avoid any unintended data loss.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, I've covered how to remove everything related to a specific app in Docker. By following these steps, you can effectively clean up your Docker environment and remove containers and images associated with the specific app. Just remember to double-check your Container and Image IDs to avoid deleting the wrong items. Docker commands can be powerful, so use them wisely.
