# Clear Python Terminal

## Introduction

When writing Python scripts, it's sometimes helpful to clear the terminal for better readability or to reset the view after running certain commands. This can be achieved using the `os.system()` function to send a system command to the underlying operating system.

## Code Example

```python
import os
os.system('cls||clear')
```

## How It Works

- **`import os`**: This imports the built-in `os` module in Python, which allows interaction with the operating system.
- **`os.system('cls||clear')`**: This function sends a command to the operating system's shell. The command is either `cls` for Windows or `clear` for Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux or macOS).
  - **`cls`**: The command used to clear the terminal in Windows.
  - **`clear`**: The command used in Unix/Linux and macOS environments.

The use of `cls||clear `ensures compatibility across different operating systems. The || operator means "or," so if the first command fails (e.g., running cls on a Unix system), the second command (clear) will be executed.

## Summary

This small snippet can be used in any Python script to clear the terminal and make your output more readable. Simply run the code whenever you need to reset the view in the terminal.
